    <h1>Computer Organization</h1>
    <h3>What is Computer Organization?</h3>
    <p>Computer Organization and Architecture is <strong>the study of internal working, structuring , and implementation of a computer system.</strong>Architecture in the computer system, same as anywhere else, refers to the externally visual attributes of system.</p>
    <h3>Basic Terminology</h3>
    <h4>*Control Unit-</h4>
    <p>A control unit (CU) handles all processor control signals. It directs all input and output flow, fetches the code for instructions and controlling how data moves around the system.</p>
    <h4>*Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU –</h4>
    <p>The arithmetic logic unit is that part of the CPU that handles all the calculations the CPU may need, e.g. Addition, Subtraction, Comparisons. It performs Logical Operations, Bit Shifting Operations, and Arithmetic Operation.</p>

<h3>Main Memory Unit (Registers)-</h3>
<h4>1-Accumulator:</h4>
<p> Stores the results of calculations made by ALU.</p>
<h4>2-Program Counter (PC): </h4>
<p> Keeps track of the memory location of the next instructions to be dealt with. The PC then passes this next address to Memory Address Register (MAR).</p>
<h4>3-Memory Address Register (MAR):</h4>
<p> It stores the memory locations of instructions that need to be fetched from memory or stored into memory.</p>
<h4>4-Memory Data Register (MDR):</h4>
<p>It stores instructions fetched from memory or any data that is to be transferred to, and stored in, memory.</p>
<h4>5-Current Instruction Register (CIR):</h4>
<p> It stores the most recently fetched instructions while it is waiting to be coded and executed.</p>
<h4>6-Instruction Buffer Register (IBR):</h4>
<p>The instruction that is not to be executed immediately is placed in the instruction buffer register IBR.</p>
<h3>Input/Output Devices –</h3>
<p> Program or data is read into main memory from the input device or secondary storage under the control of CPU input instruction. Output devices are used to output the information from a computer</p>
