    <h1>What is Computer Network?</h1>
    <p>Computer networking refers to <strong>interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other.</strong> These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.</p>

    <h3>Network Topologies:-</h3>
    <h4>*Mesh Topology:</h4>
    <p>In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channerl. If suppose, N number of devices are conneted with each other, then total number of links required to connedt Nc2.</p>
    <h4>*Bus Topology:</h4>
    <p>Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. If N devices are connected, then the number of cables required 1 which is known as backbone cable and N drop lines are required.</p>
    <h4>Star Topology:-</h4>
    <p>In star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. If N devices are connected to each other, then the no. of cables required N.</p>
    <h4>Ring Topology:-</h4>
    <p>In this topology, it forms a ring connecting a devices with its exactly two neighboring devices.</p>
    <h4>Transmission Modes:</h4>
    <h4>*Simplex Mode:</h4>
    <p>the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.</p>
    <h4>*Half- duplex Mode:</h4>
    <p>each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.</p>
    <h4>*Full-duplex Mode:</h4>
    <p>both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.</p>
