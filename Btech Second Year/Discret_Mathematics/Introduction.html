    <h1>Introduction of Sets:</h1>
    <p>A set is defined as a collection of distinct objects of the same type or class of objects. The purposes of a set are called elements or members of the set. An object can be numbers, alphabets, names, etc.</p>
    <p>Examples of sets are:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>A set of rivers of India.</li>
        <li>A set of vowels.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>We broadly denote a set by the capital letter A, B, C, etc. while the fundamentals of the set by small letter a, b, x, y, etc.</p>
        <p> If A is a set, and a is one of the elements of A, then we denote it as a ∈ A. Here the symbol ∈ means -"Element of."</p>
<h1>Sets Representation:</h1>
<p>Sets are represented in two forms:-</p>
<p><strong>a) Roster or tabular form:</strong> In this form of representation we list all the elements of the set within braces { } and separate them by commas.</p>
<p><strong>
    Example:</strong> If A= set of all odd numbers less then 10 then in the roster from it can be expressed as A={ 1,3,5,7,9}.</p> 
    <p><strong>b) Set Builder form:</strong> In this form of representation we list the properties fulfilled by all the elements of the set. We note as {x: x satisfies properties P}. and read as 'the set of those entire x such that each x has properties P.'</p> 
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If B= {2, 4, 8, 16, 32}, then the set builder representation will be: B={x: x=2n, where n ∈ N and 1≤ n ≥5}</p>

        <h1>Cardinality of a Sets:</h1> 
        <p>The total number of unique elements in the set is called the cardinality of the set. The cardinality of the countably infinite set is countably infinite.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Let P = {k, l, m, n}</li>
            <p>The cardinality of the set P is 4.</p>
            <li> Let A is the set of all non-negative even integers, i.e.</li>
            <p>A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10......}.</p>
            <p>As A is countably infinite set hence the cardinality.</p>
        </ol>
        <h1>Types of Sets</h1>
        <p>Sets can be classified into many categories. Some of which are finite, infinite, subset, universal, proper, power, singleton set, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Finite Sets:</strong> A set is said to be finite if it contains exactly n distinct element where n is a non-negative integer. Here, n is said to be "cardinality of sets." The cardinality of sets is denoted by|A|, # A, card (A) or n (A).</p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Cardinality of empty set θ is 0 and is denoted by |θ| = 0</li>
            <li>Sets of even positive integer is not a finite set.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A set is called a finite set if there is one to one correspondence between the elements in the set and the element in some set n, where n is a natural number and n is the cardinality of the set. Finite Sets are also called numerable sets. n is termed as the cardinality of sets or a cardinal number of sets.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Infinite Sets:</strong> A set which is not finite is called as Infinite Sets.</p>
        <p><strong>Countable Infinite:</strong> If there is one to one correspondence between the elements in set and element in N. A countably infinite set is also known as Denumerable. A set that is either finite or denumerable is known as countable. A set which is not countable is known as Uncountable. The set of a non-negative even integer is countable Infinite.</p>
        <p><strong>Uncountable Infinite:</strong>A set which is not countable is called Uncountable Infinite Set or non-denumerable set or simply Uncountable.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Set R of all +ve real numbers less than 1 that can be represented by the decimal form 0. a1,a2,a3..... Where a1 is an integer such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 9.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Subsets:</strong> If every element in a set A is also an element of a set B, then A is called a subset of B. It can be denoted as A ⊆ B. Here B is called Superset of A.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If A= {1, 2} and B= {4, 2, 1} the A is the subset of B or A ⊆ B.</p>
        <h3>Properties of Subsets:</h3>
        <ol type="1"><li>Every set is a subset of itself.</li>
        <li>The Null Set i.e.∅ is a subset of every set.</li>
    <li>If A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A will be the subset of C. If A⊂B and B⊂ C ⟹ A ⊂ C</li>
<li>A finite set having n elements has 2n subsets.</li> 
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Proper Subset:</strong> If A is a subset of B and A ≠ B then A is said to be a proper subset of B. If A is a proper subset of B then B is not a subset of A, i.e., there is at least one element in B which is not in A.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<ol type="i">
    <li>Let A = {2, 3, 4}</li>
    <p>B = {2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
    <p>A is a proper subset of B.</p>
    <li>The null ∅ is a proper subset of every set.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5. Improper Subset:</strong> If A is a subset of B and A = B, then A is said to be an improper subset of B.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>(i) A = {2, 3, 4}, B = {2, 3, 4}</p>
<p>A is an improper subset of B.</p>
<p>(ii) Every set is an improper subset of itself.</p>
<p><strong>6. Universal Set:</strong> If all the sets under investigations are subsets of a fixed set U, then the set U is called Universal Set.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> In the human population studies the universal set consists of all the people in the world.</p>
<p><strong>7. Null Set or Empty Set:</strong> A set having no elements is called a Null set or void set. It is denoted by∅.</p>
<p><strong>8. Singleton Set:</strong> It contains only one element. It is denoted by {s}.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> S= {x|x∈N, 7&lt;x&lt;9} = {8}</p>
<p><strong>9. Equal Sets:</strong> Two sets A and B are said to be equal and written as A = B if both have the same elements. Therefore, every element which belongs to A is also an element of the set B and every element which belongs to the set B is also an element of the set A.</p>
<p>A = B ⟺ {x ϵ A  ⟺  x ϵ B}. </p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If A= {1, 2, 6} and B= {16, 17, 22}, they are equivalent as cardinality of A is equal to the cardinality of B. i.e. |A|=|B|=3</p>
<p><strong>11. Disjoint Sets:</strong> Two sets A and B are said to be disjoint if no element of A is in B and no element of B is in A.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>R = {a, b, c}</p>
<p>S = {k, p, m}</p>
<p>R and S are disjoint sets.</p>
<p><strong>12. Power Sets:</strong> The power of any given set A is the set of all subsets of A and is denoted by P (A). If A has n elements, then P (A) has 2n elements.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A = {1, 2, 3}</p>
<p>P (A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.</p>
<h1>Partitions of a Set:</h1>
<p>Let S be a nonempty set. A partition of S is a subdivision of S into nonoverlapping, nonempty subsets. Speceficially, a partition of S is a collection {Ai} of nonempty subsets of S such that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Each a in S belongs to one of the Ai.</li>
<li>The sets of {Ai} are mutually disjoint; that is,</li></ul>
<pre>A<sub>j</sub>≠ A<sub>k</sub> Then A<sub>j</sub> ∩ A<sub>k</sub>= ∅
</pre>
<p>The subsets in a partition are called cells.</p>
