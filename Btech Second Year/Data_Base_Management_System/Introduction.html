    <center><h1>Data Base Management System</h1></center>
    <h3>What is Data Base Management System?</h3>
    <p>The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>For example:</strong> The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.
   Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.</p>
   <h3>Database Management System</h3>
   <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example: MySQL, Oracle, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different applications.</li>
    <li>DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like database creation, storing data in it, updating data, creating a table in the database and a lot more.</li>
    <li>It provides protection and security to the database. In the case of multiple users, it also maintains data consistency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DBMS allows users the following tasks:</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li> <strong>Data Definition:</strong> It is used for creation, modification, and removal of definition that defines the organization of data in the database.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Updation:</strong>  It is used for the insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data in the database.</li>
<li> <strong>Data Retrieval: </strong> It is used to retrieve the data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.</li>
<li> <strong>User Administration: </strong> is used for registering and monitoring users, maintain data integrity, enforcing data security, dealing with concurrency control, monitoring performance and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.</li></ul>
<h3>Characteristics of DBMS:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.</li>
<li>It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.</li>
<li>DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.</li>
<li>It contains ACID properties which maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure.</li>
<li>It can reduce the complex relationship between data.</li>
<li>It is used to support manipulation and processing of data.</li>
<li>It is used to provide security of data.</li>
<li>It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.</li></ul>
<h3>Advantages of DBMS</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li> <strong>Controls database redundancy:</strong> It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.</li>
<li> <strong>Data sharing: </strong>In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among multiple users.</li>
<li><strong>Easily Maintenance:</strong> It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of the database system.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce time: </strong>It reduces development time and maintenance need.
</li>
<li><strong>Backup:</strong> It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if required.</li>
<li><strong>multiple user interface:</strong>It provides different types of user interfaces like graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces</li></ul>
<h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li><strong>Cost of Hardware and Software:</strong> It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.</li>
<li><strong>Size: </strong>It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity:</strong>Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Higher impact of failure: </strong>Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.</li></ul>
