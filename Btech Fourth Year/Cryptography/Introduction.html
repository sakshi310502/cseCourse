    <h1>Cryptography</h1>
   <h2>Computer Security:</h2>
   <p>The protection of forded to an <strong>automated information</strong> system in order to oftainthe applicable objective of preserving the integinty, avilability and confidentialyof information system resources. </p>
   <h2>CIA Triad (Confidentiatly, Integinty, Avilability)</h2>
   <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong>Other should not understand except the parites were involved in the data transfer.</p>
   <p>&#8594; Need to prevent un-autherization access and discloser <strong>(eg: Account information)</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Integrity:</strong> sent=Receive</p>
   <p>Whatever sender is sending the same is receiver to receive <strong>(eg: Patient's information)</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Avilability:</strong> Insure the timely and the reliable access to the system.</p>
   <p>&#8594; Server alway avilabile:</p>
   <p><strong>eg: Authentication service</strong></p>
   <h3>Level of impact of Security branch</h3>
    <ol style="list-style-type:1">
    <li>Low</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>High</li></ol>
<p><strong>Low Level attack:</strong>There is a limited adverse effect on an organization system operation, or an indivival.</p>
<p>&#8594; <strong>Minnor harm, minnor finacal loss</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medium level effect:</strong> Serious adverse effect on organizational operation or an indivival.</p>
<p>&#8594; Significant damage</p>
<p><strong>High level effect:</strong> Completer disaster to an organization</p>
<p><strong>Additional words of CIA Triad:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Property of being genuon and being able to verify the party involved. </p>
<P>&#8594; Receiver is able to find that message is from trusted source.</P>
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Every indivival how work with organization should have specific responsibility.</p>
<h3>Threat:</h3>
<p>A potential for violation of security,which exist when there is a circumstance, capability, action or  event that could breach security and cause harm.</p>
<h3>Attack:</h3>
<p>An assoult on system security that devise from an intelligent thredt,</p>
<p>Roof <u>top, window glass (Threat)</u> issue with metal lock</p>
<p>One using roof top for theif to enter in horse is Attack using one threat.</p>
