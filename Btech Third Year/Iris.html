    <h2>XML Retrieval</h2>
    <h3>What is XML?</h3>
    • eXtensible Markup Language<br>
    • A framework for defining markup languages<br>
    • No fixed collection of markup tags<br>
    • Each XML language targeted for application<br>
    • All XML languages share features<br>
    • Enables building of generic tools<br>
    • XML - the eXtensible Markup Language has recently
    emerged as a new standard for data representation
    and exchange on the Internet.<br>
    • An XML document is an ordered, labeled tree.
    Each node of the tree is an element<br>
    • XML element and is written with an opening
    and closing tag. An element can have one or
    more XML attributes.<br>
   <h1> XML</h1>
    • The standard for accessing and processing
    XML documents is the XML Document Object
    Model or DOM.<br>
    • The DOM represents elements, attributes and
    text within elements as nodes in a tree.<br>
    • Example:
   <h2> XML Document</h2>
    • play<br>
    • author Shakespeare<br>
    • Macbeth<br>
    • act number="I"<br>
    • scene number="vii"<br>
    •Macbeth’s castle<br>
    • verseWill I with wine and wassail ...<br>
    • scene<br>
    • act<br>
    • play<br>

    <h3>XML document as DOM object</h3>
    <img src="../Image/dom object.png" alt=""width="500">
    <h2>Basic Structure</h2>
    • An XML document is an ordered, labeled tree<br>
    • character data leaf nodes contain the actual
    data (text strings)<br>
    • element nodes, are each labeled with
    – a name (often called the element type), and
    – a set of attributes, each consisting of a name and
    a value.<br>
    – can have child nodes<br>

    <h2>XML applications</h2>
    • XML application refers to an application of
    XML to a specific domain?<br>
    XML applications cont..<br>
    • CML- Chemists can create and publish
    molecule specifications for easy interchange.<br>
    • MML- To publish equations and all kind of
    mathematical terms<br>
    • CDF- introduce the idea of webcasting<br>
    • -send documents to the user rather than
    waiting for the user to come and get them
    XML applications cont..<br>
    • SMIL- has become a core part part of the
    RealNetworks streaming software( Apple
    quicktime)<br>
    SMIL lets you create fast cuts and true
    multimedia presentations.<br>
    SVG- Scalable Vector Graphics-implementation
    in Adobe products, Corel draw)—One can
    draw 2 dimensional graphics using markup
    XML applications cont..<br>
    • XUL- XML based user Interface Language—
    Enable you to describe what user interface
    elements you want those browsers to display.<br>
    • XBRL- Extensible Business Reporting languageTo describe financial statements.<br>
    • RDF- resource description framework-XML
    application that specializes in meta-data. One use
    RDF to specify info. about other resources.<br>
    • One can create vocabulary that describe resources
   <h2> Uses of XML</h2>
    • XML has a variety of uses, including:<br>
    • Web publishing: XML allows you to create
    interactive pages, allows the customer to
    customize those pages, and makes creating ecommerce applications more intuitive. With
    XML, you store the data once and then render
    that content for different viewers or devices
    based on style sheet processing using an
    XSL/XSLT processor.<br>
    <h2>Uses of XML</h2>
    • Web searching and automating Web tasks: XML
    defines the type of information contained in a
    document, making it easier to return useful
    results when searching the Web:<br>
    – For example, using HTML to search for books
    authored by Tom Wolf is likely to return instances of
    the term 'wolf' outside of the context of author. Using
    XML restricts the search to the correct context (say,
    the information contained in the <author> tag) and
    returns only the required type of information. Using
    XML, Web agents and robots (programs that
    automate Web searches or other tasks) will be more
    efficient and produce more useful results.<br>
    
    • General applications: XML provides a standard
    method to access information, making it easier
    for applications and devices of all kinds to use,
    store, transmit, and display data.<br>
    • e-business applications: XML implementations
    make electronic data interchange (EDI) more
    accessible for information interchange, businessto-business transactions, and business-toconsumer transactions.<br>
   
    • Metadata applications: XML makes is easier to
    express metadata (Unified Modeling Language
    design models or user interface properties, for
    example) in a portable, reusable format.<br>
    • Pervasive computing: XML provides portable and
    structured information types for display on
    pervasive (wireless) computing devices such as
    PDAs, cellular phones, and others.<br>
    – For example, WML (Wireless Markup Language) and
    VoiceXML are currently evolving standards for
    describing visual and speech-driven wireless device
    interfaces.<br>
    <h3>Uses of XML</h3>
    • Create other Languges
    Many languages are created using XML.<br>
    Examples are WML, MathML etc.<br>
    • Use in Databases<br>
    Modern database such as Oracle and MSSQL
    server is providing the XML support in their
    databases.<br>
    <h2>XML-related technologies.</h2>
    • DTD (Document Type Definition) is used to define the
    legal elements in an XML document.<br>
    • well-formed XML: proper nesting of elements<br>
    • (e.g. <a><b></a></b> is forbidden<br>
    • valid XML: document is well-formed and conforms to
    document type definition<br>
   <h2> Declaration of DTD</h2>
    • in the document header:<br>
    • !DOCTYPE name PUBLIC publicid systemid<br>
    • !DOCTYPE name SYSTEM filename<br>
    
    
    <h2>XML related technologies</h2>
    • XML Document Object Model (XML DOM): standard for accessing and processing
    XML documents<br>
    • The DOM represents elements, attributes and text within elements as nodes in a
    tree.<br>
    • With a DOM API, we can process an XML document by starting at the root element
    and then descending down the tree from parents to children.<br>
    • XML DOM (XML Document Object Model) defines a standard way for accessing
    and manipulating XML documents.<br>
   <h2> XML related technologies<h2>
    • XSD (XML Schema) is an XML-based alternative to DTDs.
    XML Schema<br>
    <h3>XML related technologies<h3>
    • XHTML (Extensible HTML) is a stricter and cleaner version of HTML.<br>
    • XSL (Extensible Style Sheet Language) - XSL consists of three parts: XSLT -
    a language for transforming XML documents, XPath - a language for
    navigating in XML documents, and XSL-FO - a language for formatting XML
    documents.<br>
    • XSLT (XSL Transformations) is used to transform XML documents into
    other XML formats, like XHTML.<br>
    XML-related technologies.<br>
    • XPath is a language for navigating in XML documents.<br>
    • XSL-FO (Extensible Style Sheet Language Formatting
    Objects) is an XML based markup language describing the
    formatting of XML data for output to screen, paper or other
    media.<br>
    • XLink (XML Linking Language) is a language for creating
    hyperlinks in XML documents.<br>
    • XPointer (XML Pointer Language) allows the XLink
    hyperlinks to point to more specific parts in the XML
    document.<br
    • XForms (XML Forms) uses XML to define form data.<br>
    • XQuery (XML Query Language) is designed to query XML
    data.<br>
    <h3>XML-related technologies.</h3><br>

    describing web services.<br>
    • RDF (Resource Description Framework) is an XML-based language for
    describing web resources.<br>
    • RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a format for syndicating news and the
    content of news-like sites.<br>

    <h3>IR and relational databases</h3>
    IR systems are often contrasted with relational
    databases (RDB).<br>
    • Traditionally, IR systems retrieve information
    from unstructured text (“raw” text without
    markup).<br>
    • RDB systems are used for querying relational
    data: sets of records that have values for
    predefined attributes such as employee
    number, title and salary.<br>
<h2>IR and relational databases</h2>
   <h3> Why Use XML?</h3>
    • Represent semi-structured data<br>
    – data that are structured, but don’t fit relational
    model<br>
    • XML is more flexible than DBs<br>
    • XML is more structured than simple IR<br>
    • You get a massive infrastructure for free

   <h2> Main idea: lexicalized subtrees</h2>
    <h4>Aim:</h4> to have each dimension of the vector space encode a word together with its
    position within the XML tree.<br>

    <h2>Main idea: lexicalized subtrees</h2>
    ❶ Take each text node (leaf) and break it into multiple nodes, one for each
    word. E.g. split Bill Gates into Bill and Gates<br>
    ❷ Define the dimensions of the vector space to be lexicalized subtrees of
    <h2>documents –</h2> subtrees that contain at least one vocabulary term.<br>

    <h2>Lexicalized subtrees</h2>
    We can now represent queries and documents as vectors in this space of lexicalized
    subtrees and compute matches between them,<br>
    e.g. using the vector space formalism.<br>
    Vector space formalism in unstructured VS. structured IR
    The main difference is that the dimensions of vector space in
    unstructured retrieval are vocabulary terms whereas they are
    lexicalized subtrees in XML retrieval.<br>
    
    <h3>Structural term</h3>
    There is a tradeoff between the dimensionality of the space and the accuracy of query
    results.<br>
     If we restrict dimensions to vocabulary terms, then we have a standard vector space
    retrieval system that will retrieve many documents that do not match the structure of
    the query (e.g., Gates in the title as opposed to the author element).<br>
     If we create a separate dimension for each lexicalized subtree occurring in the
    collection, the dimensionality of the space becomes too large.<br>
    Compromise: index all paths that end in a single vocabulary term, in other words all XMLcontext term pairs. We call such an XML-context term pair a structural term and denote it
    by <c, t>: a pair of XML-context c and vocabulary term t.<br>
    <br>
    Context resemblance<br>
    A simple measure of the similarity of a path cq
    in a query and a path cq<br>
    in a document is<br>
    <h4>the following context resemblance function CR:</h4>
    cq
    and cd
     are the number of nodes in the query path and document path, resp.<br>
    cq matches cd<br>
    iff we can transform cq
    into cd by inserting additional nodes.<br>
    
    Context resemblance example<br>
    CR(cq
    , cd
    ) = 3/4 = 0.75. <br>The value of CR(cq
    , cd
    ) is 1.0 if q and d are identical.<br>
    
    Context resemblance example<br>
    CR(cq
    , cd
    ) = ? CR(cq
    , cd
    ) = 3/5 = 0.6.  <br>
