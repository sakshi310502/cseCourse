    <h1>Physics</h1>
    <h2>LASER & FIBER-OPTICS</h2>
<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. <br>Laser
technology started with Albert Einstein in 1917, he has given theoretical basis for the
development of Laser.<br> The technology further evolved in 1960 when the very first laser
called Ruby Laser was built at Hughes Research Laboratoriesby T.H. Mainmann.<br>
<h2>CHARACTERISTIC OF LASER RADIATION:</h2>
The laser beam has the properties given below which distinguish it from an ordinary beam of
light.<br> Those are<br>
1. Highly directional<br><br>
2. Highly monochromatic<br>
3. Highly intense<br>
4. Highly coherence<br>
<h3>1. Highly directional:</h3>


A conventional light source emits light in all directions. On the other hand, Laser
emits light only in one direction. The width of Laser beam is extremely narrow and hence a
laser beam can travel to long distances without spreading.<br>
The directionality of laser beam is expressedin terms of divergence<br>
∆𝜃 =
𝑟2 − 𝑟1
𝑑2 − 𝑑1<br>
Where r1and r2are the radii of laser beam spots at distances of d1 and d2 respectively from
laser source.<br>
<h3>2. Highly monochromatic:</h3>
A monochromatic source is a single frequency or single wavelength source of light.<br>
The laser light is more monochromatic than that of a convectional light source. This may be
due to the stimulated characteristic of laser light. <br>The band width of convectional
monochromatic light source is 1000A0<br>
. But the band width of ordinary light source is 10 A0<br>

For high sensitive laser source is 10-8 A
0<br>

<h3>3. Highly intense:</h3>
Laser light is highly intense than the conventional light. A one milli-Watt He-Ne laser
is highly intense than the sun intensity.<br> This is because of coherence and directionality of
laser. Suppose when two photons each of amplitude ‘A’ are in phase with other, then young’s
principle of superposition, the resultant amplitude of two photons is 2A and the intensity is
4a2<br>
. Since in laser many numbers of photons are in phase with each other, the amplitude of
the resulting wave becomes ‘nA’ and hence the intensity of laser is proportional to n2A
2<br>
. So
1mw He-Ne laser is highly intense than the sun.<br>

<h3>4. Highly coherence</h3>
A predictable correlation of the amplitude and phase at any one point with other point
is called coherence.<br>In case of conventional light, the property of coherence exhibits between
a source and its virtual source where as in case of laser the property coherence exists between
any two sources of same phase.<br>
<h3>There are two types of coherence</h3>
i) Temporal coherence<br>
ii) Spatial coherence.<br>
<h4>Temporal coherence (or longitudinal coherence):<h4>
The predictable correlation of amplitude and phase at one point on the wave train w .r.
t another point on the same wave train, then the wave is said to be temporal coherence.
<h4>Spatial coherence (or transverse coherence):</h4>
The predictable correlation of amplitude and phase
at one point on the wave train w. r .t another point on a
second wave, then the waves are said to be spatial
coherence (or transverse coherence).Two waves are said to
be coherent when the waves must have same phase & amplitude.<br>
<h2>INTERACTION OF LIGHT WITH MATTER AND THE THREE QUANTUM
PROCESSES:</h2>
When the radiation interacts with matter, results in the following three important
phenomena.<br> They are<br>
(i)Induced or Stimulated Absorption<br>
(ii)Spontaneous Emission<br>
(iii)Stimulated Emission<br>
<h3>STIMULATED ABSORPTION (OR) INDUCED ABSORPTION (OR) ABSORPTION:</h3>
An atom in the lower energy level or ground state energy level (E1) absorbs the incident
photon and goes to excited state (E2) as shown in figure below. This process is called induced
or stimulated absorption.<br>
Let E1 and E2 be the energies of ground and excited states of an atom. Suppose, if a
photon of energy E2−E1 = hν interacts with an atom present in the ground state, the atom gets

excitation form ground state E1 to excited state E2 . This process is called stimulated
absorption.<br>
Stimulated absorption rate depends upon the number of atoms available in the lowest
energy state as well as the energy density of photons.<br>
<h2>SPONTANEOUS EMISSION:</h2>
The atom in the excited state returns to ground state emitting <br> a photon of energy (E) =
E2 – E1 = hv,<br> without applying an external energy spontaneously is known as spontaneous
emission.<br>
Let E1 and E2 be the energies of ground and excited states of an atom.<br> Suppose,
 if
photon of energy E2− E1 = hν <br>interacts with an atom present in the ground state, the atom gets
excitation form ground state E1 to excited state E2<br>
The excited atom does not stay for a long time in the excited state.<br> The excited atom
gets de-excitation after its life time by emitting a photon of energy E2− E1 = hν .<br> This process
is called spontaneous emission.<br>
The spontaneous emission rate depends up on the number of atoms present in the excited
state.<br>
The probability of spontaneous emission (P21) is independent of u(𝜗)<br>.
𝑃21 = 𝐴21<br>
<h3>STIMULATED-EMISSION:</h3>
The atom in the excited state can also returns to the ground state by applying external
energy or inducement of photon thereby emitting two photons which are having same energy
as that of incident photon. This process is called as stimulated emission.<br>
Stimulated emission was postulated by Einstein. Let E1 and E2 be the energies of
ground and excited states of an atom. Let a Photon of energy E2-E1=hυ<br> interacts with the
excited atom with in their life time The atom gets de-excitation to ground state by emitting of
another photon. These photons have same phase and it follows coherence.<br> This phenomenon
is
called stimulated emission<br>
Stimulated emission rate depends upon the number of atoms available in the
excitedstate as well as the energy density of photons.<br>
Comparison between Spontaneous and Stimulated emission:<br>
Spontaneous emission Stimulated emission<br>
1. The spontaneous emission Was1.The stimulated emission was
Postulated by Bohr. Postulated by Einstein.<br>
2. Additional photons are not required 2.Additional photons are required in
in spontaneous emission. Stimulated emission.<br>
3. OnePhoton is emitted in 3. Two photons are emitted in
spontaneous emission. stimulated emission.<br>
4. The emitted radiation is incoherent.<br> 5. The emitted radiation is coherent.
5. The emitted radiation is less intense.<br> 6. The emitted radiation is high intense.
<h2>Light Amplification:</h2>
Light amplification requires stimulated emission exclusively. In practice, absorption
and spontaneous emission always occur together with stimulated emission.<br> The laser
operation is achieved when stimulated emission exceeds the other two processes due to its
higher transitions rates of atomic energy levels.<br>
<h2>POPULATION INVERSION:</h2>
The number of atoms present in the excited (or higher) state is greater than the number
of atoms present in the ground energy state (or lower state) is called population inversion.<br>
Let us consider two level energy systems of energies E1and E2as shown in figure. Let
N1 and N2 be the population (means number of atoms per unit volume) of E1and E2
respectively.<br>
According to Boltzmann’s distribution the population of an energy level E, at temperature T
is given by<br>
𝑁𝑖 = 𝑁𝑜𝑒
(−
𝐸𝑖
𝑘𝐵𝑇
)
𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑖 = 1,2,3, … . 𝑁𝑖<br>
where ‘N0’ is the number of atoms in ground or lower energy states & k is the Boltzmann
constant.<br>
From the above equation the population of energy levels E1& E2 are given by
𝑁1 = 𝑁𝑜𝑒
(−
E1
𝑘𝐵𝑇
)<br>

𝑁2 = 𝑁𝑜𝑒
(−
𝐸2
𝑘𝐵𝑇
)<br>
At ordinary conditions N1>N2 i.e., the population in the ground or lower state is
always greater than the population in the excited or higher states.<br> The stage of making,
population of higher energy level greater than the population of lower energy level is called
population inversion i.e., N2>N1.<br>
<h2>METASTABLE STATE:</h2>
In general the number of excited particles in a system is smaller than the non excited
particles. The time during which a particle can exist in the ground state is unlimited. On the
other hand, the particle can remain in the excited state for a limited time known as life time.<br>
The life time of the excited hydrogen atom is of the order of 10-8
sec.<br> However there exist
such excited states in which the life time is greater than 10-8
sec. <br>These states are called as
Meta stable states.<br>
<h2>PUMPING MECHANISMS (OR TECHNIQUES):</h2>
Pumping:<br>
The process of rising more no of atoms to the excited state by artificial means is called
pumping.<br>
A system in which population inversion is achieved is called as an active system. The
method of raising the particles from lower energy state to higher energy state is called
pumping. (or the process of achieving of population inversion is called pumping). This can be
done by number of ways.<br> The most commonly used pumping methods are<br>
 Optical pumping<br>
 Electrical discharge pumping<br>
 Chemical pumping<br>
 Injection current pumping<br>
<h2>Optical pumping:</h2>
Optical pumping is used in solid laser. Xenon flash tubes are used for optical
pumping. Since these materials have very broad band absorption, sufficient amount of energy
is absorbed from the emission band of flash lamp and population inversion is created.<br>
Examples of optically pumped lasers are ruby, Nd: YAG Laser ( Y3 AL5G12 )
(Neodymium: Yttrium Aluminum Garnet), Nd: Glass Laser<br>
<h2>Electrical discharge pumping:</h2>
Electrical discharge pumping is used in gas lasers. Since gas lasers have very narrow
absorption band pumping them any flash lamp is not possible. Examples of Electrical
discharge pumped lasers are He-Ne laser, CO2 laser, argon-ion laser, etc<br>
<h3>Chemical pumping:<h3>
Chemical reaction may also result in excitation and hence creation of population
inversion in few systems. Examples of such systems are HF and DF lasers.<br>
<h3>Injection current pumping:<h3>
In semiconductors, injection of current through the junction results in creates of
population inversion among the minority charge carriers. Examples of such systems are InP
and GaAs.<br>
<h2>PRINCIPLE OF LASER/LASING ACTION:<h2>
Let us consider many no of atoms in the excited state. Now the stimulating photon
interacts with any one of the atoms in the excited state, the stimulated emission will occur.<br> It
emits two photons, having same energy & same frequency move in the same direction.<br> These
two photons will interact with another two atoms in excited state & emit 8-photons. In a
similar way chain reaction is produced this phenomenon is called “Principle of lasing –<br>
action”. We get a monochromatic, coherent, directional & intense beam is obtained. This is
called laser beam. This is the principle of working of a laser.<br>
<h3>Components of a LASER:</h3>
Any laser system consists of 3-important components. They are<br>
(i) Source of energy or pumping source<br>
(ii) Active-medium (Laser Material)<br>
(iii)Optical cavity or resonator<br>
<h3>(i) Energy Source :<h3> It supply energies & pumps the atoms or
molecules in the active medium to excited states. As a result we
get population inversion in the active medium which emits
laser.<br>
Ex: Xenon flash lamp, electric field.<br>

<h3>(ii) Active medium:<h3> The medium in which the population inversion takes place is called as
active medium.<br>
<h3>Active-centre:<h3> The material in which the atoms are raised to excited state to achieve
population inversion is called as active center.<br>
<h3>(iii) Optical-cavity or resonator:</h3> The active medium is enclosed between a fully reflected
mirror & a partially reflective mirror. This arrangement is called as cavity or resonator. As a
result, we get highly intense monochromatic, coherence laser light through the non-reflecting
portion of the mirror.<br>
<h2>DIFFERENT TYPES OF LASERS</h2>
<h3>On the basis of active medium used in the laser systems, lasers are classified into several
types</h3>
I. Solid lasers : Ruby laser, Nd;YAG laser, Nd;Glass<br>
II. Liquid lasers : Europium Chelate laser, SeOCl2<br>
III. Gas lasers : CO2, He-Ne, Argon-Ion Laser<br>
IV. Dye lasers : Rhodamine 6G<br>
V. Semiconductor lasers : InP, GaAs.<br>
<h2>RUBY LASER</h2>
Ruby laser is a three level solid state laser and was developed by Mainmann in 1960.
Ruby (Al2O3+Cr2O3) is a crystal of Aluminium oxide, in which 0.05% of Al+3 ions are
replaced by the Cr+3 ions. The colour of the ruby rod is pink. The active medium in the ruby
rod is Cr+3 ions.<br>
<h3>Principle or Characteristics of a ruby laser:</h3>
Due to optical pumping, the chromium atoms are raised to excited states then the atoms come
to metastable state by non-radiative transition. Due to stimulated emission the transition of
atoms takes place from metastable state to ground state and gives a laser beam.<br>
<h3>Construction:</h3>
 In ruby laser 4cm length and 5mm diameter rod is generally used.<br>
 Both the ends of the rods are highly polished and made strictly parallel.<br>
 The ends are silvered in such a way, one becomes partially reflected and the other end
fully reflected.<br>
 The ruby rod is surrounded
by xenon flash tube, which
provides the pumping light
to excite the chromium ions
in to upper energy levels.<br>

 Xenon flash tube emits thousands joules of energy in few milli seconds, but only a
part of that energy is utilized by the chromium ions while the rest energy heats up the
apparatus.<br>
 A cooling arrangement is provided to keep the experimental set up at normal
temperatures.<br>
<h3>Working:</h3>
 The energy level diagram of chromium ions is shown in figure.<br>
 The chromium ions get excitation into higher energy levels by absorbing of 5600A0
of wave length radiation.<br>
 The excited chromium ions stay in the level H for short interval of time (10-8 Sec).<br>
 After their life time most of the chromium ions are de-excited from H to G and a few
chromium ions are de-excited from H to M.<br>
 The transition between H and M is non-radioactive transition i.e. the chromium ions
gives their energy to the lattice in the form of heat.<br>
 In the Meta stable state the life time of chromium ions is 10-3
sec.<br>
 Due to the continuous working of flash lamp, the chromium ions are excited to
higher state H and returned to M level.<br>
 After few milli seconds the level M is more populated than the level G and hence
the desired population inversion is achieved.<br>
 The state of population inversion is not a stable one.<br><br>
 The process of spontaneous transition is very high.
 When the excited chromium ion passes spontaneously from H to M it emits one
photon of wave length 6943A0
.<br>
 The photon reflects back and forth by the silver ends and until it stimulates an
excited chromium ion in M state and it to emit fresh photon in phase with the earlier
photon.<br>
 The process is repeated again and again until the laser beam intensity is reached to a
sufficient value.<br>
 When the photon beam becomes sufficient intense, it emerges through the partially
silvered end of the rod.<br>
 The wave length 6943A0
is in the red region of the visible spectrum on returning to
ground state (G).<br>

<h2>He-Ne LASER</h2>
It was discovered by A. Javan & his co-workers in 1960. It is a continuous wave gas laser. It
consists of mixture of He & Ne in 10:1 ratio as a active medium.<br>
<h3>Principle/Characteristics of He-Ne laser:</h3>
This laser is based on the principle of stimulated emission, produced in the He & Ne. The
population inversion is achieved due to the interaction between He & Ne gases.Using gas
lasers, we can achieve highly coherent, directional and high monochromatic beam.<br>
<h3>Construction:</h3>
 In He-Ne gas laser, the He and Ne gases are taken in the ratio 10:1 in the discharge
tube.<br>
 Two reflecting mirrors are fixed on either ends of the discharge tube, in that, one is
partially reflecting and the other is fully reflecting.<br>
 In He-Ne laser 80cm length and 1cm diameter discharge tube is generally used.<br>
 The output power of these lasers depends on the length of the discharge tube and
pressure of the gas mixture.<br>
 Energy source of laser is provided by an electrical discharge of around 1000V through
an anode and cathode at each end of the glass tube.<br>
<h3>Working:</h3>
 When the electric discharge is passing through the gas mixture, the electrons
accelerated towards the positive electrode.<br>
 During their passage, they collide with He atoms and excite them into higher levels.<br>
 F2 and F3 form F1. In higher levels F2 and F3, the life time of He atoms is more.<br>
 So there is a maximum possibility of energy transfer between He and Ne atoms
through atomic collisions.<br>
 When He atoms present in the levels F2 and F3 collide with Ne atoms present ground

 state E1, the Ne atoms gets excitation into higher levels E4 andE6.<br>
 Due to the continuous excitation of Ne atoms, we can achieve the population
inversion between the higher levels E4 (E6) and lower levels E3 (E5).<br>
 The various transitions E6→ E5, E4→ E3 and E6→ E3 leads to the emission of
wavelengths 3.39A⁰, 1.15 A⁰ and 6328A0<br>
.
 The first two corresponding to the infrared region while the last wavelength is
corresponding to the visible region.<br>
 The Ne atoms present in the E3 level are de-excited into E2 level, by spontaneously
emission of photon.<br>
 When a narrow discharge tube is used, the Ne atoms present in the level E2 collide
with the walls of the tube and get de-excited to ground level E1.<br>
<h3>Uses of He-Ne laser:</h3>
- Used in laboratories foe all interferometric experiments.<br>
- Used widely in metrology in surveying, alignment etc.<br>
- Used to read barcodes and He-Ne laser scanners also used for optical character
recognition.<br>
- Used in holography.<br>
<h2>SEMICONDUCTOR LASER</h2>
A Semiconductor diode laser is specially fabricated p-n junction device that emits coherent
light when it is forward biased. The wavelength of the emitted photon depends upon the
activation energy of crystal.<br>
<h2>Principle:</h2> When a p-n junction diode is forward biased, the electrons from n – region and the
holes from the p- region cross the junction and recombine with each other.<br>During the
recombination process, the light radiation (photons) is released from a certain specified direct
band gap semiconductors like Ga-As. This light radiation is known as recombination
radiation.<br>
The photon emitted during recombination stimulates other electrons and holes to recombine.<br>
As a result, stimulated emission takes place which produces laser.<br>
<h3>Construction<h3>
Figure shows the basic construction of
semiconductor laser.<br>
 The active medium is a p-n junction diode
made from the single crystal of gallium
arsenide.<br>
 This crystal is cut in the form of a platter
having thickness of 0.5μmm.<br>
 The platelet consists of two parts having
an electron conductivity (n-type) and hole
conductivity (p-type).<br><br>
 The photon emission is stimulated in a
very thin layer of PN junction (in order of
few microns).<br>
 The electrical voltage is applied to the crystal through the electrode fixed on the upper
surface.<br>
 The end faces of the junction diode are well polished and parallel to each other. They act
as an optical resonator through which the emitted light comes out<br>
<h3>Working:</h3>
Figure shows the energy level diagram of semiconductor laser.<br>
 When the PN junction is forward biased with large applied voltage, the electrons and
holes are injected into junction region in considerable concentration.<br><br>
 The region around the junction contains a large amount of electrons in the conduction
band and a large amount of holes in the valence band.<br>
 If the population density is high, a condition of population inversion is achieved.<br>

 The electrons and holes recombine with each other and this recombination’s produce
radiation in the form of light.<br>
 When the forward – biased voltage is increased, more and more light photons are emitted
and the light production instantly becomes stronger.<br>
 These photons will trigger a chain of stimulated recombination resulting in the release of
photons in phase.<br><br>
 The photons moving at the plane of the junction travels back and forth by reflection
between two sides placed parallel and opposite to each other and grow in strength.
 After gaining enough strength, it gives out the laser beam of wavelength 8400o A . The
wavelength of laser light is given by<br>
